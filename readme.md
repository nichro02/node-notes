# STEPS TO SET UP NODE PROJECT
1. mkdir new directory
2. cd into new directory
3. run npm init (or npm init-y)
4. if running just npm init, hit enter through steps (skip this step if npm init-y entered in step )
5. look for name of  entry point ('main') file -> this will be the js file we need to create
6. touch js file that matches name in main in json package
